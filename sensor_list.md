# Sensor List for Smart Agriculture

1. **Soil Moisture Sensor**  
   - Detects water levels in the soil

2. **DHT11 / DHT22**  
   - Measures temperature and humidity

3. **Light Sensor (LDR)**  
   - Detects sunlight levels

4. **Soil pH Sensor**  
   - Checks soil acidity or alkalinity

5. **Rain Sensor**  
   - Detects rainfall presence

All these sensors connect to a microcontroller (e.g., ESP32), which sends the data to a local Edge device or cloud service.
